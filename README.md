# Pomodoro-App

A minimalist Pomodoro timer to boost productivity.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks (5 minutes). After completing four pomodoros, you take a longer break (15-20 minutes).

The technique helps combat procrastination, improve focus, and reduce mental fatigue by working in short, focused bursts with regular breaks.

## How It Works

1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Take a 5-minute break
3. Repeat
4. After 4 cycles, take a longer 15-minute break
